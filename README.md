# Technopōl


This is the proect page for the Technopōl project (name subject to change).


The project currently uses the SquareWear v2.2 (our Arduino died on us. Getting a new one soon)
SquareWear: https://rayshobby.net/sqrwear/

The HID serial monitor is for debugging purposes and is used by SquareWear in place of the built-in Arduino serial monitor.

The Fritzing File assumes and Arduino Uno R3. Pinout is the same on the SquareWear.
